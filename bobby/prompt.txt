# prompt 1
We want to create fake e-commerce data that looks realistic enough for database and SQL practice — but not use any real customer data.
So, we’ll generate synthetic data (fake data that resembles real-world patterns).

We'll make around 5 CSV files, each representing a different table in a typical e-commerce system.

# prompt 2
We already have 5 synthetic CSV files:
customers.csv
products.csv
orders.csv
order_items.csv
payments.csv
Now we’ll ingest (import) these files into an SQLite database called ecom.db so we can later run SQL queries on them.

#prompt 3
“Write a Python script that connects to the SQLite database ecom.db, runs an SQL query joining customers, orders, and payments tables, and prints 
the total number of orders and total amount spent by each customer.”
